# Cobblemon Neowo
This pack started off as "Let's play Cobblemon with some friends!" and evolved into quite the variety pack after taking input from quite a 'fruitful' group of great friends.
## Features
- Cobblemon with a number of addons and integrations
- Most Optifine features present
- Lots of QOL tweaks
- GUNS from Vic's Point Blank
- Multiple horde/mob mods
- Some factory/automation mods because I'm a needy gremlin :3

And much more! Click on a [version on Mondrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/cobblemon-neowo/versions) to see the included mods!
